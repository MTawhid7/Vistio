## 2026-02-20

### Current State

**Tier 0 — Foundation complete.** All 13 crates scaffolded and implemented. 111 tests passing, zero clippy warnings. CLI runs all 3 benchmark scenarios end-to-end.

### Progress

- Completed Phase 1 (workspace, types, math)
- Completed Phase 2 (mesh, I/O, material)
- Completed Phase 3 (telemetry, debug, GPU abstraction)
- Completed Phase 4 (solver skeleton, contact traits)
- Completed Phase 5 (benchmark suite, render trait, CLI)
- Refactored all inline tests to separate `tests/` directories

### Key Observations

- PD stub solver produces correct ballistic trajectories (gravity-only, no elastic forces)
- All 3 benchmark scenarios run under 40ms total in debug build
- The `SolverStrategy` and `ContactResponse` trait APIs are clean and extensible
- CSV metrics export works end-to-end via CLI

### Issues & Decisions

- **Decision:** Used `mpsc` channels for telemetry bus (simplest thread-safe option; can upgrade to crossbeam later if needed)
- **Decision:** Chose bincode for state snapshots (compact binary, fast serialize/deserialize)
- **Decision:** Kept `SolverConfig` serializable as TOML for human-editable config files
- **Note:** Live visual rendering not yet implemented (Tier 2), only the `Renderer` trait and `HeadlessRenderer` stub exist

### Next Steps

- [ ] **Tier 1:** Implement real Projective Dynamics solver (local-global iteration loop)
- [ ] **Tier 1:** Implement `faer`-based sparse Cholesky solver for the global step
- [ ] **Tier 1:** Implement spatial hash broad phase for self-collision candidates
- [ ] **Tier 1:** Implement vertex-triangle narrow phase proximity tests
- [ ] **Tier 2:** Implement `WgpuRenderer` for live visual simulation
- [ ] **Tier 2:** Implement `WgpuBackend` for GPU-accelerated compute
