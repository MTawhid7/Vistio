//! IPC log-barrier function for contact handling.
//!
//! Implements the C² log-barrier from Li et al. 2020 (IPC):
//!
//! b(d, d_hat) = -(d - d_hat)^2 * ln(d / d_hat),  for 0 < d < d_hat
//! b(d, d_hat) = 0,                                for d >= d_hat
//!
//! The barrier has compact support (zero contribution when primitives are
//! far apart) and goes to +inf as d -> 0 (prevents interpenetration).

/// Compute the IPC log-barrier energy.
///
/// Returns 0 when `d >= d_hat`. Goes to +∞ as `d → 0⁺`.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `d` — squared distance between primitives (must be > 0)
/// * `d_hat` — activation threshold (barrier is zero when d >= d_hat)
